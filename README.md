# How to guide on surviving the Titanic.

This repo is aimed at the beginner Machine Learning practitioner and includes a walkthrough of the starter ML Kaggle competition problem. 

The aim of this problem is to predict the chances of survival of a passenger on board the Titanic given some information about the passenger, such as their class, gender, age and number of family members also aboard.

The first part of this problem involves some basic data exploration. This has been kept to a less than extensive level to allow the user to expand upon this with their own ideas, and to keep this walkthrough short and to the point.

The second part then involves applying an ML model to the organised data, some hyperparameter tuning and finally obtaining a generalisation error by using some test data.

The jupyter notebook includes some running commentary to explain each step and to allow user interation at each step. Alternatively the full end to end solution from the notebook is included in some pure python code and can be run from the command line with `python main.py`.

Happy coding!
